# tri-robot_maze-solving_system

## Project Overview

This project consists of a three-robot maze solver where the first robot searches for a button with an IR emmiter in it placed at the base of a ramp. The second robot climbs the ramp, recognizing it has reached the end of the ramp when the top part of the ramp falls into a platform. The second robot then tells the first robot to press the button to reveal an Apriltag containing encoded coordinates of the escape point. The second robot then sends these coordinates to the third robot which then goes to the escape point.

See the system in the demo video below:
